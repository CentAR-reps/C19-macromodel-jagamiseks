	abstract = {Demand elasticities are the best available indicators of how households may respond to policies which change relative prices and the level and distribution of income. In this study, income and price elasticities for eight commodity groups are estimated for Turkey based on the LES by using household level data compiled from the 1994 Household Income and Consumption Expenditures Survey conducted by the State Institute of Statistics. All estimates obtained as a result of the estimation procedure are consistent with a priori expectations and satisfy the underlying utility theory requirements.},

	url = {https://ideas.repec.org/p/tax/taxpap/0013.html},
	abstract = {Value Added Tax (VAT) in Europe is regularly subject to intensive debate. It is often argued that the current VAT system should be made more uniform to enhance economic efficiency and to protect the functioning of the internal market. But it is also regularly argued that extending reduced VAT to this or that particular product would create economic benefits such as more employment and less inequality. The study concludes that there seems to be a strong argument for making the current VAT structure more simple and uniform, but also an argument for selective cuts in VAT rates primarily in locally supplied services and parts of the hospitality sector. The authors stress the need to consider each case on its own merits and to appraise whether alternative non-VAT instruments may be preferable to reduced VAT rates.},
